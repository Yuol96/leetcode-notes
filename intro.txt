# Introduction

Welcome!

In order to hone my algorithm skills, I have been continuing working on leetcode questions since August 2018. 
To put more focus on algorithms, I choose python3 as my programming language, since it seems to be easier to implement an idea.
Most of the questions have a specific `.py` file under the `solutions/` folder, while some of questions have multiple versions of solutions. 

If you are interested in this repo, feel free to fork it and put your solutions to it. 
Whenever you want to add a new python solution, you need first create a `<id-of-leetcode-question>[.<version-name>].py` file under `solutions/` folder.
You also need to prepend a multi-line comment to your code. Typically it looks like:
```python
"""
{
    "author": "Yucheng Huang",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "link": "https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/",
    "beats": 0.9000,
    "category": ["dynamic-programming"],
    "tags": ["your-whatever-tag-name"],
    "questions": []
}
"""
```
You may also want to add some explaination to your code.
Finally, save your file and input `make` command into your command line tool under the root dir of this repo.
This command collects all the information within the headers of all solutions and regenerate the README.md file.

You should note that without prepending a proper header to your solution files, the `make` command might fail.

I will keep on updating this repo and working on more leetcode questions. You can add this repo into your watchlist so that you will get notified whenever there's an new commit.
